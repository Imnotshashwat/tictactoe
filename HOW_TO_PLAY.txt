# Tic-Tac-Toe (Python, Text-Based)

## How to Play

- **Players:** 2 (Player X and Player O)
- **Goal:** Be the first to get three of your marks in a rowâ€”vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

### Instructions:

1. When the game starts, the board is empty. Player X starts.
2. On your turn, enter the row and column numbers (each between 1 and 3) to place your symbol:
   - Example: If you enter `row: 2` and `column: 3`, your symbol goes in the middle row, right column.
3. If a square is already taken, the game will ask you to pick another spot.
4. The game checks after every move for a win (three in a line) or a draw (all spots filled).
5. The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins.
6. If the board fills up and nobody wins, it's a draw.
7. To play again, run the script from the start.

### Sample Turn

Player X's turn.
Enter row (1-3): 2
Enter column (1-3): 3


- This puts X in the middle row, rightmost column.

### Tips

- The game is played in the terminal/console: follow the prompts!
